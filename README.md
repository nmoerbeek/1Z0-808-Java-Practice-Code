1Z0-808 Java Practice Code
This Repository is made for writing some practice code in preparation for the Java Associate Exam.

When writing the examples because I used a main() in each seperate examples, I encountered errors using the Netbeans debugger.  I did not have the same problem with Eclipse.  

I am not of the mind that writing out tons of code helps for preparation with certification exams, unless you have no experience working with the language on real projects, however it can be very helpful to step through the code to understand underlying concepts with the language, especially if you have worked with other languages extensively such as C++, or C# and when looking at code exampls your mind defaults to the way those languages work. 

I do not intend to make this a complete repository of examples.  Nor do I intende to continue to work on it after I after passed the exam.
